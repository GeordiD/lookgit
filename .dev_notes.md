# Dev Notes

This should be a next app. Server side rendering would make a lot of sense.

Ok the goal for this is to focus on the github integration. 

Do we need a database? Probably... 
Do we use rest or graphql or both?
  - Lets do what I know - rest
What are good test repos to use for this?
  - https://github.com/HubSpot/hubspot-cli 

What insights are we looking for?
- Leaderboard of PRs / Reviews 
- Categorizing types of PRs and types of reviews
  - Drafts, one offs, tiny PRs don't really count for much
  - Self reviews, no look reviews don't really count for much either
- Remove bad LOC from LOC count (so lockfiles don't count)
- Some ratios
  - Comments per LOC
  - % of no comment reviews
- Timeline view, to a users reviews/PRs in context (and account for changes in behavior)

Path

Register repo

Add repo ref to table
Run sync

For now, literally ignore users
